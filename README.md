## How to use the tool
 * Open a terminal in the project folder.
 * Run npm install to install project dependencies.
 * Run node Main.js to start the backend server.
 * Open the index.html file to open the frontend (http://localhost:8080/)
 * Upload your first pdf file to the first file upload field.
 * Upload your second pdf file to the second file upload field.
 * To add more pdf files, use the ‘add more’ button to add more file upload field rows.
 * Click the ‘Submit’ button to start the merge. It can take a few moments to merge to complete.
 * Check ouput folder in your unzip folder collections. 
 
 - Note: pdf files will be merged in order from the top file upload field to the bottom file upload field.


 ### Next version I'm about to develop:

* Handle all the exceptions
* Change behaviour of the merge PDF file
